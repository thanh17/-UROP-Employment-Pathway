ABILITIES/SKILLS/Knowledge:
	QUESTION : IN Identifying the Multiple Skills in Skill-Biased
Technical Change, how were the 8 catgories determined in relation to the 20ish subcategories of ONET skills? 

	Level: 0-7
	Importance: 1-5
	-Aggregated all the data 
	-K-Means using abilities, skills, knowledge
	- OR just one
		abilities/skills/knowledge that are most similar or aggregate
	-element_id: natural categories
 	
	-> Potential to see which ones in these can be automated	 
	1.A. = abilities
	1.A.1 = cognitive abilities
		1.A.1.a : Verbal abilities
		1.A.1.b: Idea Generation and Reasoning Abilities
		1.A.1.c: Quantitative Abilities
	1.A.2 = Psychomotor Abilities
		1.A.2.a: Fine Manipulative Abilities
	1.A.3 = Physical Abilities
	1.A.4 = Sensory Abilities	
	1.B. = Interests
	1.C = Work Styles
	
	2 = Workers Requirements
	2.A = Basic Skills
	2.B = Cross-Functional Skills
	2.C = Knowledge
		2.C.1: Business and Management
	2.D = Education

	3 = Experience Requirements
	3.A = Experience and Training
	
	Occupation_data: same thing, default categories set up
	15-11XX: computer software
	17-20XX: Engineer
	PERHAPS one could look within those categories and see which types of engineer would be closest, etc. 
		but...may not be as effective. 
	Supervised ML...but where it fails would be having some abilities be cross-role, etc. 
	But it seems like based on the graphs, it would be better to forgo looking at these categories

	Potential clustering algorithm:
		build a model based on 1-x where each number represent each skills/abilites/knowledge lv/importance.
		Most overlap == the most similar model
	k-means where based on overlap of the occupation data
	x = lvl y = importance ...but perhaps some form normalization for the categories.
	Do that for each skill set?
TECHNOLOGY SKILLS/ TOOLS:
	defnitely a union
	Commodity Code and Family Code:
		This can be used to see which tools lie in the same family...which I think can be used to transfer one's skills
	Example:
		20100000: Mining and quarrying machinery and equipment family 	
	Best to do a frequency analysis on these skills/tools and group them based on tools family
		Supervised
BOTH:
	Not SURE about the algorithm...I'd have to read up on more clustering techniques...but
		The main thing is that there is not a level/importance for tech skills/tools...so a different approach is needed

TASKS:
	Type: Core and Supplement
	FT: frequency of Tasks: 
		Categories:	
		1-7
		1: Yearly or less
		7: Hourly or more

		data_value: 0 -100
	RT: Relevance of Task
		0: 
		100:
