Plot other jobs onto engineers
	-median split
Plot tools (indeed union) and skills (too long)
PLot Tasks
Reading the developmental report
	Calculated specific domains - interested  
	
Djikstra's with job changes matrix
	lot of development:
		Not sure which part you need to improve on (Can be done though w/ more analysis)
		Can't weight certain skills/knowledge as more than others/can't include tools
		Top 10 only...not sure if it'd be better to have more nodes?
	Tried to do visualization but...nope lol

Only data left to look at is job zones and work context...haven't been able to
